   <h3>Project Description</h3>
   <p> BookMark-It is an innovative web platform with a mission to empower dyslexic authors by offering a sanctuary for self-publishing, personal profile creation, book promotion, and engaging discussions. The platform ensures 100% of profits flow back to authors, providing a fair reward for their hard work. Designed to be dyslexia-friendly, it promotes inclusivity for all users with learning abilities, granting equal access to the world of literature. The platform allows authors to upload their work, offering free PDF previews for users to explore before making a purchase. BookMark-It aims to be a hub for diverse books, fostering meaningful discussions and direct connections between authors and readers. Committed to inclusivity, it fills a gap by providing dyslexia-friendly books not always available on mainstream platforms. BookMark-It establishes an inclusive space for authors and readers with learning difficulties, featuring user accounts, collaboration tools and payment functionality. With differentiated user experiences for Regular Users and Authors, the platform includes main navigation pages like Home, Favourites, Wishlist, Contact, About, Forum, Profile, Settings, and Cart, along with author-exclusive pages for Upload and Books.

   The project's scope is to create a comprehensive and user-friendly platform that encourages collaboration, discussion, and seamless interactions between authors and readers. BookMark-It targets a diverse audience, focusing on self-publishing authors facing challenges in promoting their work and dealing with learning difficulties, especially dyslexia. BookMark-It employs a robust technological framework to guarantee both security and accessibility. Front-end development involves HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the dyslexia-friendly OpenDyslexic font. The back end leverages Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB/MongoDB Atlas for efficient server-side operations and flexible, scalable data management. Security is reinforced through PayPal integration for secure transactions and encrypted user data. Version control and project management are handled with GitHub, ensuring code security, collaboration, and updates. Visual Studio Code provides an integrated development environment, supporting the seamless integration of chosen technologies. Non-functional requirements ensure accessibility through dyslexia-friendly fonts, and easy-to-read interfaces. Database efficiency is maintained with MongoDB, while performance is optimized for fast response times. The platform prioritizes usability, compatibility across devices and browsers, and a reliable notification system to enhance user engagement. This strategic alignment of tools ensures BookMark-It is not only secure but also accessible and user-friendly.

   BookMark's unique features are tailored to meet the specific needs of authors, offering a platform that transcends traditional self-publishing. The ability to upload books is a game-changer for authors. Whether it's a PDF, other formats, or a hardcover edition, authors can provide details like the book title, number of pages, and associated genres. Once uploaded, the book instantly appears on the homepage for everyone to see.
   Authors wield complete control, being able to edit their books and set the prices as they see fit. The freedom to choose is at the core. On the platform, authors have a comprehensive view of all their uploaded books, including upload dates, likes, reviews, and purchases. This flexibility allows authors to make adjustments whenever they want. Authors on the platform earn a verified status, establishing trust and credibility, making a clear distinction between users and authors. The platform becomes a haven for authors to engage in discussions with others, new or experienced, navigating the intricacies of self-publishing. It serves as a launching pad for emerging authors, providing insights and guidance for their literary journey. The platform ensures easy access and availability to all its features for all users. Users can personalize their profiles with photo content, allowing for customization of profile pages and personal settings. Background color change, font color change, kids mode, and audio options enhance inclusivity, especially for users with learning disabilities. Users can effortlessly add books to their favorites and Wishlist, simplifying the process of finding desired content without endless searching. Authors receive the recognition they deserve, with their books open to reviews, likes, and social media sharing. Direct purchases from the website are facilitated through secure payment transactions via PayPal, adding a layer of convenience and trust to the entire process. BookMark not only redefines self-publishing but also provides a user-friendly, feature-rich platform that caters to diverse needs and preferences.

   In a competitive literary world dominated by established authors, BookMark-It recognizes the struggles faced by emerging authors, particularly those with learning difficulties. Traditional publishing can be daunting and costly, and existing platforms often take a substantial cut of authors' profits. BookMark-It aims to fill this gap by providing a solution tailored to the unique needs of dyslexic authors, offering a fair and supportive environment for their voices to be heard and their stories to thrive. It is not just a platform for self-publishing; it is a dynamic community that empowers dyslexic authors. From uploading and showcasing books to engaging in discussions about the intricacies of the publishing process, the platform goes above and beyond to address the specific needs of its users. It stands as a beacon of inclusivity in the literary world, ensuring that every voice, especially those with learning difficulties, can thrive. </p>
